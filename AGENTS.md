# Project notes for AI agents

## Workflow preferences
- **Always commit AND deploy together.** When deploying, also commit the changes
  to git (and vice versa). Don't leave deployed work uncommitted.

## Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Lint: `npm run lint` (or `npx eslint <files>`)
- Typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Deploy to production: `npx vercel --prod --yes`
- Cap over-ceiling player values (one-time DB fix): `npm run cap:player-values`

## Conventions
- Player (card) values are capped at `MAX_PLAYER_VALUE` (1e12) via
  `capPlayerValue` / `MAX_PLAYER_VALUE_SQL` in `src/lib/safeguards.ts`. Clamp any
  new value-growth site with these so values never approach `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
  (which makes cards unaffordable/unpurchasable).
- Credits are capped at `MAX_CREDITS` (`MAX_CREDITS_SQL`) in the same file.
